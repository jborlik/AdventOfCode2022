# AdventOfCode2022
Python code to solve daily puzzles of http://adventofcode.com/2022

Code is tested with Python 3.9.7 (Anaconda distribution) on Win10. Developed with VSCode.

## Days

* Day 1:  Reading a list, sum over some partitions.  From looking at solutions on Reddit, it seems like most people followed the same algorithm, but the fastest did the parsing with lots less typing/effort.  08:33(4725) / 11:09(4164)
* Day 2:  Rock paper scissors, with part 2 requiring one to pick the winning/losing/drawing action.  17:25(7048) / 30:25(8234) due to distractions.
* Day 3:  Set intersections, made easy by Python 'set'.  13:13(4341) / 19:14(3538)
* Day 4:  Another set intersection question.  Got started late:  30:10  11599, 32:17  10092
* Day 5:  Move items between stacks by a set of instructions, popping/append or (part 1) moving whole sections at a time.  Some more complex input parsing too, and solutions on Reddit seemed to have people that simply hardcoded it.  40:18   7927 / 59:23   9804
* Day 6:  Iterate through a string to find first set of unique characters.  Pretty straightforward with collections.Counter.  15:24   9398 / 17:27   8572
* Day 7:  Parse command-line commands + results to determine a directory tree, and then do some size calculations.  Lots of parsing / typing, and I'm amazed that some people did it in ~5 minutes.  49:34   4770 / 1:11:57   5981
* Day 8:  Look along a matrix in a couple of directions.  Just did it more-or-less brute force, but there must have been a faster way to do this.  33:20   6237 / 1:00:41   6490
* Day 9:  Have a point follow around another.  Part 2 extended it to a whole list of points, like a rope flapping in the breeze.  39:11   5656 / 1:05:46   4782
* Day 10:  Follow instructions to increment a register (not unusual for AoC!).  Part 2 involved using the evolution of it to write a message in pixel art!.  27:18   5813 / 43:58   4346
